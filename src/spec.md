# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rename and update the app’s user-facing branding to “yourlove” while keeping the existing Valentine invitation functionality unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace existing app-name strings in the UI (e.g., the main builder page heading and footer text) with “yourlove”.
- Update the HTML document/browser tab title to “yourlove”.

**User-visible outcome:** The app displays “yourlove” as the name in the main builder page, footer, and browser tab, with all Valentine invitation creation and sharing behavior working as before.
